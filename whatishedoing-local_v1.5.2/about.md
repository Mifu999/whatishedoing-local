## Profile manager

On this mod's settings page, open **Manage Profiles** to work with up to 10 named slots.
Don't forget to save a profile after you add/remove a level from the ID filter!

- **Save** stores a snapshot of your **last-applied** mod settings into that slot.
- **Load** applies a saved slot, updates the active custom text file, and closes settings popups. Slot 1's file is used until you load another.
- **Rename** changes the slot's display name.
- **Delete** clears that slot. If its custom text slot was active, slot 1's file becomes active.
